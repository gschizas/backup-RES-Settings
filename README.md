<b>backupRESSettings</b>

<b>What:</b> The backupRESSettings.sh script will search for RES (Reddit Ehancement Suite) installs on your computer
and make a copy of them in an archive at a location you choose.

<b>Why:</b> Backups are good, and especially right now for firefox users because firefox has been deleting res settings on reset.

<b>Who:</b> This script currently only works for users running Mac OS X. I am currently working on re-writing into a cross-platform
version.

<b>How:</b> The script works by checking the location of many different locations different browsers use to store your RES settings.  Then if
the file is found it is added to a backup file which is stored at the location you specify.

<b>Where:</b> Check the releases for the latest working version, or download the latest commit.
